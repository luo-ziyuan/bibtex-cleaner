# How to extend this file
# - Keep entries as a YAML list (each starts with "- id: ...").
# - Fields: id (unique across all files, lowercase, no spaces), type (conference|journal|organization), full, abbreviation, acronym, variants[], patterns[].
# - Quote all strings; patterns are Python regex; avoid adding workshop patterns unless that is the intent.
# - Add new items under the closest "# -- ..." subgroup; create a new subgroup comment if needed.
# - Prefer ASCII text; keep consistent abbreviations/variants to improve matching.
# arXiv top-level: econ - Economics, Law & Society
# Sub-groups are lightweight clusters for readability.
